# UnitFramesImproved
Extends the Blizzard unitframes for better visuals, with a minimal-ish footprint

## Changes from Version 1
- The mainline is now only supporting Retail WoW 10.0 with modern UI
- Added dependency on Ace3 to not have to reinvent the wheel all the time

## Open Issues
- Support removed for Classic and WotLK, for now please use old versions on CurseForge

## Distribution
Packaged and distributed via CurseForge
